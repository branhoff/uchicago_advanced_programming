    "##### Long Version\n",
    "I've decided to write a class to help me in a goofy little video game I like to play, Stardew Valley. Stardew Valley is a simple little \"farming\" simulation game in the vein of Harvest Moon. That's putting it simplistically... but this isn't Stardew Apologetics. Wikipedia can explain it better than me: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardew_Valley\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the primary features of this game is (obviously) farming. You can buy seeds for a variety of crops and plant them with various different growth rates and then sell them at different prices. Being the sort of perfectionist I am at these kinds of silly, resource building games I immediatley wanted to maximize my revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking online, I immediately understood from the sites I was visiting that these authors really didn't understand the idea of compounding. When trying to find recommendations on crops during different seasons to focus on to make the most money, all of the articles I read evaluated crops in terms of \"coins per day\". Essentially, if something like (price-cost)/growth. This sounds right for most people, but I knew immediatley that a better model would be a compounding return model. Essentially, it relates to that old riddle you might have heard when you were a kid: \"Would you rather have a million dollars a day, or have a penny double every day for a month\". And if anyone does the map, despite that a penny doubling doesn't seem like it would get very far any time soon, you'll quickly realize how quickly it adds up, easily dwarfing a million dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "So naturally, I knew that it wasn't simple enough to evaluate crops from a \"earnings per day\" method when you can reinvest those earnings for duration of 28 days. So I wanted to calculate what that would be for every crop to make an informed decision on which crop to invest in. But, since this is a little made up world, I had to write very specific rules other than the standard compounding formula (which would be easy to write a function for).\n",
    "\n",
    "Things like, for instance, if the shop is closed, you can't buy the crop to plant that day, so you need a way to calculate what the return will be if you have to reinvest every 5 days rather than every 4 days. Also, there are no fractions in this game. So you often will buy some number of seeds that's an integer and your return will be an integer. So something to track the remainder for every purchase and then reinvests the revenue and the remainder was necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also two different types of crops that effect this class. Firstly, some crops have a set growth duration. Meaning than if you plant them on x day, they will yield a crop x + n days. These types of crops are what I call \"nonrenewable\" You plant, you harvest them, and then you must replant them with the proceeds from your harvest. However some crops, are what I call \"renewable\". They continue to produce on a cycle without having to be replanted. They always have long intial durations and for the first harvest, and then have shorter durations for every subsequent harvest. So the fist yield may take 10 days but subsequently they will continue to reyield crops without having to replant seeds."
